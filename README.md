Our goals:

1. Raise the bar on best practices for digital-asset custodianship by building a greater understanding of different custody use cases, risk models, and adversary analyses.
2. Prepare for newer custody technologies that break older models for custodianship.

#SmartCustody supports our shared blockchain infrastructure, improving the security of our cryptocurrencies, identity wallets, and other digital assets. The first edition of our book on the topic is now out, covering randomness, risk modeling, and fiduciary duties in 186 pages. We also present a cold-storage self-custody scenario. Thanks to our early patrons, this first edition is free: you can download a [PDF](https://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookV101) or you can get a [hardcopy from Lulu](https://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookViaLulu) at cost.

We are also preparing to work on [the second edition of the book](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md), which will dramatically expand the content and include new hardware wallets, a multisignature scenario, and information on fidicuary multisigs. You can help us realize this new edition by becoming a [sponsor](https://www.smartcustody.com/sponsors/), either as a [recurring patron at GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons) or by [supporting #SmartCustody with Bitcoins through our BTCPay](https://smartcustody.btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/).

#SmartCustody is a project of [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com), which supports blockchain infrastructure, internet security & cryptographic research.
