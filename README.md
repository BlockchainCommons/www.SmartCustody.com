*"The use of advanced cryptographic tools to improve the care, maintenance, control, and protection of digital assets."*

Our goals:

1. Raise the bar on best practices for digital-asset custodianship by building a greater understanding of different custody use cases, risk models, and adversary analyses.
2. Prepare for newer custody technologies that break older models for custodianship.

We are coordinating a series of workshops and inviting key ecosystem participants to share and learn the latest in technical and regulatory custody considerations. #SmartCustody is a project of [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com), which supports blockchain infrastructure, internet security & cryptographic research.

## First Workshop: Simple Cold Storage & Self-Custody

Our first #SmartCustody workshop will be on Tue, January 29, 2019, 10:00 AM â€“ 4:00 PM PST, at 554 San Antonio Road, Mountain View, CA 94040-1217, [Map](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/smartcustody-simple-cold-storage-self-custody-workshop-tickets-54426618481#map-target).

This is the first of three different #SmartCustody workshops. This workshop is designed for individual holders of digital assets, in particular cryptocurrency traders and those high net-worth individuals who are already familiar & working with digital assets, but are seeking to learn best practices for protecting themselves and their business from theft, fraud, or loss.

- Are you considering all possible threats to your digital assets?
- Do you have comprehensive procedures to assess your risk profile?
- How does your system stack up against others in industry?

Future workshops will be focused on holders of digital assets that have fiduciary responsibility to others, such as small investment funds & family firms, and those who are required to use third-party qualified custodians for management of digital assets due to the amount of funds held.
