*"The use of advanced cryptographic tools to improve the care, maintenance, control, and protection of digital assets."*

Our goals:

1. Raise the bar on best practices for digital-asset custodianship by building a greater understanding of different custody use cases, risk models, and adversary analyses.
2. Prepare for newer custody technologies that break older models for custodianship.

#SmartCustody is meant to support our shared blockchain infrastructure, to improve the security of your cryptocurrencies, identity wallets, and other digital assets.

#SmartCustody is a project of [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com), which supports blockchain infrastructure, internet security & cryptographic research.

## Future Events & Mailing List

Simple Cold Storage & Self-Custody is the first of three different #SmartCustody workshops. Future workshops will be focused on holders of digital assets that have fiduciary responsibility to others, such as small investment funds & family firms, and those who are required to use third-party qualified custodians for management of digital assets due to the amount of funds held.

Keep apprised of our workshop and release of best-practices and other educational documents through our email newsletter:
