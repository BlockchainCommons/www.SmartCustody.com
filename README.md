# #SmartCustody

“Smart Custody” is the use of advanced cryptographic tools to improve the *care*, *maintenance*, *control*, and *protection* of digital assets.

The website and is an educational project of [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com).

## Our Goals

* Raise the bar on best practices for digital asset custodianship by helping build a greater understanding of different custody use cases, risk modeling, and adversary analysis.
* Prepare for newer custody technologies that break older models for custodianship

To achieve this, we are coordinating a series of workshops and inviting key ecosystem participants to share and learn the latest in technical and regulatory custody considerations.

## First Workshop

Our first one-day #SmartCustody Workshop is currently planned for mid-November 2018, in the San Francisco Bay Area. Pricing has not been finalized, but expected to be about $25,000 for up to 5 attendees per company.

The day is designed for cryptocurrency traders and high net worth individuals familiar and working with digital assets looking to learn best practices for protecting their business from theft, fraud or loss.

The day will cover leading practices for the industry as well as advanced concepts, including but not limited to:
* Basics of cryptocustody, and intro to smart custody
