*"The use of advanced cryptographic tools to improve the care, maintenance, control, and protection of digital assets."*

Our goals:

1. Raise the bar on best practices for digital-asset custodianship by building a greater understanding of different custody use cases, risk models, and adversary analyses.
2. Prepare for newer custody technologies that break older models for custodianship.

We are coordinating a series of workshops and inviting key ecosystem participants to share and learn the latest in technical and regulatory custody considerations. #SmartCustody is a project of [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com), which supports blockchain infrastructure, internet security & cryptographic research.

## Second #SmartCustody Workshop: Simple Cold Storage & Self-Custody

Our second #SmartCustody workshop will be on Monday, March 29, 2019, 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM PST, at 554 San Antonio Road, Mountain View, CA 94040-1217, [Map](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/smartcustody-simple-cold-storage-self-custody-workshop-tickets-59357758654#map-target).

You can signup for the Workshop on [EventBrite](http://bit.ly/SmartCustodyWorkshop2).

### Overview

This workshop series is one of three different kinds of #SmartCustody workshops. This specific series of workshop is designed for individual holders of digital assets, in particular cryptocurrency traders and those high net-worth individuals who are already familiar & working with digital assets, but are seeking to learn best practices for protecting themselves and their business from theft, fraud, or loss.

- Are you considering all possible threats to your digital assets?
- Do you have comprehensive procedures to assess your risk profile?
- How does your system stack up against others in industry?

Future workshops will be focused on holders of digital assets that have fiduciary responsibility to others, such as small investment funds & family firms, or those who are required to use third-party qualified custodians for management of digital assets due to the amount of funds held.

These #SmartCustody workshops are a project of [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com), which supports blockchain infrastructure, internet security & cryptographic research.

## Wrapping up our First #SmartCustody Workshop

Our first #SmartCustody workshop, on [Simple Cold Storage & Self-Custody](https://www.smartcustody.com/2019-01-04-First-SmartCustody-Workshop-Simple-Cold-Storage-and-Self-Custody/) was held on Tue, January 29, 2019, 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM PST, in Mountain View, California. This workshop was designed for individual holders of digital assets, in particular cryptocurrency traders and those high net-worth individuals who are already familiar & working with digital assets, but were seeking to learn best practices for protecting themselves and their business from theft, fraud, or loss.

We asked them the questions:

- Are you considering all possible threats to your digital assets?
- Do you have comprehensive procedures to assess your risk profile?
- How does your system stack up against others in industry?

We had 17 people signup for this event from a very diverse set of backgrounds, including: two attorneys, a hedge-fund advisor, a Bitcoin Core contributor, a Dash blockchain expert, some operations and IT people, a long-tem bitcoin HODLer, and few people from an upcoming custodial service. All participants received a printed workbook, titanium tiles, engraving tools, waterproof paper and permanent marker, dice and EFF word list, and Pamela Morgan's book on Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning.

### Workshop Sessions

The morning of the workshop focused on a cold-storage scenario meant to introduce the larger process of how custory scenarios are created, and how and why various risk decisions were made (especially since mitigating one risk might increase a different risk). We also covered in  detail nine of twenty-four digital asset "adversaries" that we've identified and had a good discussion about them.
