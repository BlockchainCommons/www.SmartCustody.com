caption: TBD
description: This cold-storage scenario presumes a holder with a significant amount of digital assets (>5% of net worth), but who largely holds investments long term and does not actively trade these digital assets. The holder has full and legal custody of the assets and has no fiduciary responsibility to others. These assets may be mutually held by both primary holder and the holderâ€™s spouse, who are beneficiaries to each other and thus assets should not be subject to probate. The holder should have some sophisticated computer technical skills, but does not need to be developer.
