## Blockchain Commons Releases First #SmartCustody Book

_Your digital assets are more vulnerable you might think!_

Following on the success of its #SmartCustody workshop held in early 2019, Blockchain Commons has released _#SmartCustody: Use of Advanced Cryptographic Tools to Improve the Care, Maintenance, Control, and Protection of Digital Assets_, by Christopher Allen & Shannon Appelcline, an 186-page book detailing "the use of advanced cryptographic tools to improve the care, maintenance, control, and protection of digital assets." It's what you need to read to ensure that you don't lose your Bitcoins, your Ether, or your self-sovereign identity, and it's available for [free download](https://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookV101) from Blockchain Commons.

This first #SmartCustody book focuses on a risk-modeling exercise, which teaches digital-asset holders to itemize their assets, assess vulnerabilities, and resolve those problems. It does so using the foundation of a robust 14-step cold storage self-custody scenario and a set of 27 personified adversaries who may be trying to steal your digital goods. 

Though this first book is focused on a self-custodian scenario, it also discusses fiduciary duties and demonstrates how the risk-modeling exercise may be used for the more complex scenario of a family fund. Future #SmartCustody releases will expand on dual-control, multisignatures, and other #SmartCustody technologies required for custodianship models of that sort.

_#SmartCustody_ was refined through two years of peer-review with experts in the field, including contributors to open-source project such as Bitcoin Core, blockchain technology companies like Blockstream, Ledger, and Tokensoft, and a variety of blockchain attorneys. It was further updated based on feedback from our Mountain View workshop. If you're a small Bitcoin holder, a cryptocurrency trader, or a fund manager, _#SmartCustody_ can offer you procedural techniques and adversarial insights to improve the security of your digital assets.

Authors Christopher Allen and Shannon Appelcline are both experienced in the field of digital security and digital identity.
